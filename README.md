Time SF Berlin
==============

Simple Pebble watchface with two timezones: San Francisco (local time of your Pebble watch) &amp; Berlin. If there's already tomorrow in Berlin, a small *+1* will be shown.

Based on Pebble's Simplicity watchface (see https://github.com/pebble/pebblekit).

Created with the awesome [CloudPebble IDE](https://cloudpebble.net/ide/).
